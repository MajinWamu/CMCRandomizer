## Welcome!
I'm very excited to present the Capsule Monster Coliseum Randomizer! This will allow you to shuffle up all sorts of elements from the main game and play through it as if it was a brand new experience!  
All you will need is an official NTSC Yu-Gi-Oh Capsule Monster Coliseum game, or the ReCap mod (coming soon).

# Features
### Seeds
There are two parts to a seed. The first part is the seed reference number for the random generator. A seed is used to generate the same pRNG sequence of numbers, but it will not give the exact same outcome unless you either use the exact same setting, or, for your convenience, use the second part of the seed, which is the options pattern. With these two inserted together, you and your friend(s) can play the exact same layout. This is great for competition or racing purposes, or just to experience the setup. If you have the setup code, click on the Apply Settings button for the options to automatically be selected in the application.

### Quick Options
This will quickly randomize all elements of the same category. selecting one of these boxes will automatically tick relevant boxes.

### Opponents
This tab will allow you to select which opponent's lineups you want shuffled. This will shuffle both the blue and red side separately. In other words, if you play on the blue side during your initial playthrough, try to play through the red side to experience a completely different lineup. (Excellent for new game+)

### Levels
This tab will allow you to select if you want to randomize particular opponent's monster levels. You can select the range of the levels (the minimum and maximum level). These options are great for even when you don't want to randomize the monsters, but just want to play the base game with an increased challenge.

### Options
Extra options. More to come

### Other things
You can randomize each of the monster's movement and attack patterns, creating a completely new experience, treating the game as if it was the first time you have ever played it!

### Features Coming Soon
* The ability to have each opponent have unique monsters, no two opponents will have the same monsters (this is only relevant to the color side).
* The ability to omit and add particular monsters.
* Smart Symbols: Symbol types will be changed based off the number of a certain attribute the opponent has. More wood will generate a wood symbol.
* The ability to randomize or remove unit limits. This option I’ll need more time to study. Making the unit limit too high can soft lock you if you select too many monsters. It was an original feature, but I had to remove it for now.

### Have questions? Comments? Ideas?
You can reach out to me on discord, just look for MajinWamu. My icon is the same there as it is here. I look forward to hearing from you!

### Special Thanks
I want to thank ManakoDE for opening my mind to the bigger world of reverse engineering. It was by chance that we met, and I'm forever thankful. None of this wouldn't had been possible if it wasn't for him.  
I also want to thank my wife who supports me every step of the way in everything I do, even if it leads to nothing. Thank you ♥
