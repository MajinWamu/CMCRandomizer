## Welcome!
I'm very excited to present the Capsule Monster Coliseum Randomizer! This will allow you to shuffle up all sorts of elements from the main game and play through it as if it was a brand new experience!  
All you will need is an official NTSC Yu-Gi-Oh Capsule Monster Coliseum game, or the ReCap mod (coming soon).

## Support

Your contribution will keep me going and allow me to create more awesome software like this for all to enjoy!

# Features
### Seeds
There are two parts to a seed. The first part is the seed reference number for the random generator. A seed is used to generate the same pRNG sequence of numbers, but it will not give the exact same outcome unless you either use the exact same setting, or, for your convenience, use the second part of the seed, which is the options pattern. With these two inserted together, you and your friend(s) can play the exact same layout. This is great for competition or racing purposes, or just to experience the setup. If you have the setup code, click on the Apply Settings button for the options to automatically be selected in the application.

### Quick Options
This will quickly randomize all elements of the same category. Selecting one of these boxes will automatically tick relevant boxes.

### Monsters
Currently this section gives you additional options you can set when randomizing monsters, but in a future release you will be able to individually add and remove monsters from the main game.  
The current settings allow you to include the 77 unsupported monsters, omit fusions and evolutions from the shuffle, and shuffle each monster's class and their attribute. With these settings are your disposal, you can create a completely unique experience unlike any you've had so far, increasing the reliability of the game nearly infinitely!  
Other options allow you to shuffle up the monster's class, attribute types, movement and attack patterns, creating a brand new game that is unrecognizable from the original.

### Opponents
This tab will allow you to select which opponent's lineups you want shuffled. This will shuffle both the blue and red side separately. In other words, if you play on the blue side during your initial playthrough, try to play through the red side to experience a completely different lineup. (Excellent for a new game+ experience)  
You also have a list of options you can turn on and office in the Opponents Options menu. One key option is the ability to have each opponent use unique monsters, so no two opponents will have the same monsters (this is only relevant to the color side).

### Levels
This tab will allow you to select if you want to randomize particular opponent's monster levels. You can select the range of the levels (the minimum and maximum level). These options are great for even when you don't want to randomize the monsters, but just want to play the base game with an increased challenge.

### Options
These are general options that don't fit in individual sections. Currently they include giving the ability to remove each level's MP and AP limits.   
Removing Tool Tips will disable the little descriptive pop-ups that appear.  
More options to come in future releases.

### Features Coming Soon
* The ability to omit and add particular monsters.
* The ability to randomize or remove unit limits. This option I’ll need more time to study. Making the unit limit too high can soft lock you if you select too many monsters. It was an original feature, but I had to remove it for now.

### Have questions? Comments? Ideas?
You can reach out to me on discord, just look for Majin Wamu. My icon is the same there as it is here. I look forward to hearing from you!

### Special Thanks
I want to thank ManakoDE for opening my mind to the bigger world of reverse engineering. It was by chance that we met, and I'm forever thankful. None of this wouldn't had been possible if it wasn't for him.  
I also want to thank my wife who supports me every step of the way in everything I do, even if it leads to nothing. Thank you ♥
